##About:
Dave's Maze Game (I'll probably change that title later) is a dungeon crawler game written in MEAN stack JavaScript. It's an exploration of 1st-person 3D in the browser, as well as (eventually!) some simple AI concepts. The technologies involved are as follows:
 - **AngularJS 1.x** for awesome front-end stuffs
 - **MongoDB** for storing all your epic adventures
 - **Mongoose** for saying "hi!" to mongodb
 - **ExpressJS** for servers
 - **NodeJS** for JavaScript on the back-end
 - **Socket.IO** for mobile integration (still in development!). This allows you to to use your phone as a contorller
 - **CSS3** Because CSS can do 3D, and CSS really isn't that bad, so stop whining.
 - **A Heck of a Lot of NPM/Bower Modules** Because if someone else has already done it, why rewrite it?

##Currently Under Development:
 - I'm always added more stuff like loot, monsters, skills, etc.
 - A profession system is currently in development. This will allow you to choose from a subset of skills
 - Skill purchasing via leveling up
 - Armor weights (Heavy/Light)
 - A storyline!

##How You Can Help:
Writing this app takes a lot of time and love. 
 - You can help by forking the repo and writing more monsters, weapons, armor, loot, skills, etc., and making a pull request. 
 - If I like your additions, I'll include em! 
 - Take a look at the [models folder](https://github.com/Newms34/mazeGame/tree/master/models) or the [seeds folder](https://github.com/Newms34/mazeGame/tree/master/seeds) to get an example of what the format is! Be aware that as I'm currently developing the profession/skill purchasing system, some information might change without notice.
 - I'm also pretty bad at the whole art thing. Right now, I'm using other people's glorious art as 'placeholders'. However, if you feel like contributing something, feel free. 

##License:
 Eh, do whatever you want. Seriously. I give you permsission.
