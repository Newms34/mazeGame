##About:
Dave's Maze Game (I'll probably change that title later) is a dungeon crawler app written in MEAN stack JavaScript. It's an exploration of 1st-person 3D in the browser, as well as (eventually!) some simple AI concepts. The technologies involved are as follows:
 - **AngularJS** 1.5 for awesome front-end stuffs
 - **MongoDB** for storing all your epic adventures
 - **Mongoose** for saying "hi!" to mongodb
 - **ExpressJS** for servers
 - **NodeJS** for JavaScript on the back-end
 - **CSS3** Because CSS can do 3D, and CSS really isn't that bad
 - **A Heck of a Lot of NPM/Bower modules** Because if someone else has already done it, why rewrite it?

##Stuff To Be Added:
 - Monsters!
 - Loot!
 - Annoying NPCs!
 - Quests!
 - Bosses!
 - Even more epic skills!
 - Possibly phone navigation support!

##How You Can Help:
Writing this app takes a lot of time and love. 
 1. You can help by forking the repo and writing more monsters, weapons, armor, loot, skills, etc., and making a pull request. 
 2. If I like your additions, I'll include em! 
 3. Take a look at the [models folder](https://github.com/Newms34/mazeGame/tree/master/models) or the [seeds folder](https://github.com/Newms34/mazeGame/tree/master/seeds) to get an example of what the format is!
 4. I also suck as an artist! Feel free to illustrate your skills/weapons/armor/etc.! Keep in mind that all pictures will be scaled to 55x55 px, so don't waste too much time on one picture!

##License:
 Eh, do whatever you want. Seriously. I give you permsission.
