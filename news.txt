Beginnings of an inventory system (WIP)!
Turn - based Combat
3D Maze generation
Works on the MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) stack!
Phone navigation support (WIP)!
Yes, it's pretty much pure JavaScript!
Semi-random loot generator picks a general weapon and adds a prefix and suffix modifier. Loot currently doesn't drop, but this will be used for it!
New weapon effects! Includes: 
Stun: chance to prevent enemy from taking next turn
Nova: chance to cause a 'nova' of a particular damage type for additional damage
Confusion: chance for enemy to damage itself instead of you!
Vampiric: heals you for a small amount of the weapon damage when you attack
Cruel: increased duration of damage-over-time stuff (like burning)
Brutal: increased damage
Benedictive: increased healing
Rejuvenating: increased duration of health regen spells
Various 'attunement' mods: Each of these increases defense towards a particular damage type by a certain amount. But be careful! they also weaken you to two other damage types (e.g., an Axe of Shielding has additional defense against physical damage, but leaves you vulnerable to fire and ice attacks)!
