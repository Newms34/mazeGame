How do we wanna implement mobile devices?
probly left-tilt right-tilt for left-right movement
Other control inputs include:
tilt forward/back: can use, but may be difficult to get it to stop on one PARTICULAR item
dragging
simple clicking (tapping?)
best would be some sort of scroll interface to choose skills, a la TR4's inv ring system

possibly implement movement pause on the client side? this needs to be designed so that tilting the phone doesnt cause continuous key-pressing.

IMPLEMENT BROWSER CHECKING (seems to only work in chrome!)

When should we save?:
 - When user clicks save
 - when user clicks save+exit
 - on leveling
 - before each boss?
 - others?

Should user heal outside of combat?

TO DO:
1) Add more monsters
2) Rewrite bootbox to be less bootstrappy?
3) Stat check system should be fine.
4) ADD MOAR LOOTS so we dont keep getting the freakin cook's ring!
5) BEGIN quest system (?!)
6) need to include energy costs in skill usage.
