How do we wanna implement mobile devices?
probly left-tilt right-tilt for left-right movement
Other control inputs include:
tilt forward/back: can use, but may be difficult to get it to stop on one PARTICULAR item
dragging
simple clicking (tapping?)
best would be some sort of scroll interface to choose skills, a la TR4's inv ring system

possibly implement movement pause on the client side? this needs to be designed so that tilting the phone doesnt cause continuous key-pressing.

Cloud9

IMPLEMENT BROWSER CHECKING (seems to only work in chrome!)

When should we save?:
 - When user clicks save
 - when user clicks save+exit
 - on leveling
 - before each boss?
 - others?

Should user heal outside of combat?

TO DO:
1) Add more monsters
2) Stat check system should be fine.
3) ADD MOAR LOOTS so we dont keep getting the freakin cook's ring!
4) BEGIN quest system (?!)

quest instantiation:
 - when user reaches a certain lvl. This'll need to be some percentage (or fixed range?) BEFORE the quest's designated level
 - from merchant. Again, when user reaches appropriate lvl

 LINE 80 on mainjs is replacing merch cell's has.inv with the data directly from back-end. Need to replace ONLY item data (and thus preserve lootType and number). should begin to alleviate merch NaN issue. should also check how items are 'delivered' once bought, to playerItems.inv

leveling sys: 
need to designate levels for each spell. 
should level PURELY be based on dungeon level? or should we gain xp after each fight?

RENAME PRIEST TO "CORRUPTED PRIEST"

skill upgrade process: after each fight, you get xp depending on level of monster. This is then used in a level system (linear? logarithmic?). After each level, you get a skill point. You can then use accumulated skill point(s) to buy skills. First tier skills are automatically given. 2nd tier costs 1 pt, 3rd tier costs 2 points, 4th tier... 4 points? yet to decide.

reset game doesnt seem to be working

NEED TO MAKE ICICLE DO 2x DMG VS STUNNED. Can (should!) we use this effect for other stuff too
