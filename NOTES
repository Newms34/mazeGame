How do we wanna implement mobile devices?
probly left-tilt right-tilt for left-right movement
Other control inputs include:
tilt forward/back: can use, but may be difficult to get it to stop on one PARTICULAR item
dragging
simple clicking (tapping?)
best would be some sort of scroll interface to choose skills, a la TR4's inv ring system

possibly implement movement pause on the client side? this needs to be designed so that tilting the phone doesnt cause continuous key-pressing.
