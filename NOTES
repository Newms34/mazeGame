How do we wanna implement mobile devices?
probly left-tilt right-tilt for left-right movement
Other control inputs include:
tilt forward/back: can use, but may be difficult to get it to stop on one PARTICULAR item
dragging
simple clicking (tapping?)
best would be some sort of scroll interface to choose skills, a la TR4's inv ring system

possibly implement movement pause on the client side? this needs to be designed so that tilting the phone doesnt cause continuous key-pressing.

IMPLEMENT BROWSER CHECKING (seems to only work in chrome!)

When should we save?:
 - When user clicks save
 - when user clicks save+exit
 - on leveling
 - before each boss?
 - others?

Should user heal outside of combat?

change to weapon/armor/combat sys:
we NEED to implement more effects for weapons, since right now there's no reason to have a lower dmg weapon vs. a higher one. Ideas:
1) weap:chance to stun 0 - 100%
2) weap:chance to cast a specific 'nova' of a particular type (frost nova, poison nova, dark nova) on hit 0-100%
3) armor: chance to prevent stun
4)
